- `volume_size` (int) - Size of the volume to request, in gigabytes.
  
  The size specified must be in range of the sizes for the chosen volume type.

- `volume_type` (BlockDeviceType) - The volume type is the type of storage to reserve and attach to the instance being provisioned.
  
  The following values are supported by this builder:
  * scratch: local SSD data, always 375 GiB (default)
  * pd_standard: persistent, HDD-backed disk
  * pd_balanced: persistent, SSD-backed disk
  * pd_ssd: persistent, SSD-backed disk, with extra performance guarantees
  * pd_extreme: persistent, fastest SSD-backed disk, with custom IOPS
