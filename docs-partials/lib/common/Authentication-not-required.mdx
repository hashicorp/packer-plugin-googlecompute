- `access_token` (string) - A temporary [OAuth 2.0 access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)
  obtained from the Google Authorization server, i.e. the `Authorization: Bearer` token used to
  authenticate HTTP requests to GCP APIs.
  This is an alternative to `account_file`, and ignores the `scopes` field.
  If both are specified, `access_token` will be used over the `account_file` field.
  
  These access tokens cannot be renewed by Packer and thus will only work until they expire.
  If you anticipate Packer needing access for longer than a token's lifetime (default `1 hour`),
  please use a service account key with `account_file` instead.

- `account_file` (string) - The JSON file containing your account credentials. Not required if you
  run Packer on a GCE instance with a service account. Instructions for
  creating the file or using service accounts are above.

- `credentials_file` (string) - The JSON file containing your account credentials.
  
  The file's contents may be anything supported by the Google Go client, i.e.:
  
  * Service account JSON
  * OIDC-provided token for federation
  * Gcloud user credentials file (refresh-token JSON)
  * A Google Developers Console client_credentials.json

- `credentials_json` (string) - The raw JSON payload for credentials.
  
  The accepted data formats are same as those described under
  [credentials_file](#credentials_file).

- `impersonate_service_account` (string) - This allows service account impersonation as per the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts).

- `vault_gcp_oauth_engine` (string) - Can be set instead of account_file. If set, this builder will use
  HashiCorp Vault to generate an Oauth token for authenticating against
  Google Cloud. The value should be the path of the token generator
  within vault.
  For information on how to configure your Vault + GCP engine to produce
  Oauth tokens, see https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp
  You must have the environment variables VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN set,
  along with any other relevant variables for accessing your vault
  instance. For more information, see the Vault docs:
  https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables
  Example:`"vault_gcp_oauth_engine": "gcp/token/my-project-editor",`
