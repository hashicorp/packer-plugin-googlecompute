<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BlockDevice struct in builder/googlecompute/block_device.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `attachment_mode` (string) - How to attach the volume to the instance
  
  Can be either READ_ONLY or READ_WRITE (default).

- `device_name` (string) - The device name as exposed to the OS in the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* directory
  
  If unspecified, the disk will have a default name in the form
  persistent-disk-x with 'x' being a number assigned by GCE
  
  This field only applies to persistent disks, local SSDs will always
  be exposed as /dev/disk/by-id/google-local-nvme-ssd-x.

- `disk_encryption_key` (CustomerEncryptionKey) - Disk encryption key to apply to the requested disk.
  
  Possible values:
  * kmsKeyName -  The name of the encryption key that is stored in Google Cloud KMS.
  * RawKey: - A 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encodes in RFC 4648 base64.

- `disk_name` (string) - Name of the disk to create.
  This only applies to non-scratch disks. If the disk is persistent, and
  not specified, Packer will generate a unique name for the disk.
  
  The name must be 1-63 characters long and comply to the regexp
  '[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?'

- `interface_type` (string) - The interface to use for attaching the disk.
  Can be either NVME or SCSI. Defaults to SCSI.
  
  The available options depend on the type of disk, SEE: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent-disks#choose_an_interface

- `iops` (int) - The requested IOPS for the disk.
  
  This is only available for pd_extreme disks.

- `keep_device` (bool) - Keep the device in the created disks after the instance is terminated.
  By default, the builder will remove the disks at the end of the build.
  
  This cannot be used with 'scratch' volumes.

- `replica_zones` ([]string) - The list of extra zones to replicate the disk into
  
  The zone in which the instance is created will automatically be
  added to the zones in which the disk is replicated.

- `source_volume` (string) - The URI of the volume to attach
  
  If this is specified, it won't be deleted after the instance is shut-down.
