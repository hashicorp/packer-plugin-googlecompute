# Google Compute Builder

Type: `googlecompute`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.googlecompute`

The `googlecompute` Packer builder is able to create
[images](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/images) for use with
[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine) (GCE)
based on existing images.

It is possible to build images from scratch, but not with the `googlecompute`
Packer builder. The process is recommended only for advanced users, please see
[Building GCE Images from Scratch](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/building-images)
and the [Google Compute Import
Post-Processor](/packer/plugins/post-processors/googlecompute/googlecompute-import) for more
information.

## Authentication

To authenticate with GCE, this builder supports everything the plugin does.
To get more information on this, refer to the plugin's description page, under
the [authentication](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/googlecompute#authentication) section.

## Configuration Reference

Configuration options are organized below into two categories: required and
optional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and
described.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required:

@include 'builder/googlecompute/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'builder/googlecompute/Config-not-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/googlecompute/IAPConfig-not-required.mdx'

### Startup Scripts

Startup scripts can be a powerful tool for configuring the instance from which
the image is made. The builder will wait for a startup script to terminate. A
startup script can be provided via the `startup_script_file` or
`startup-script` instance creation `metadata` field. Therefore, the build time
will vary depending on the duration of the startup script. If
`startup_script_file` is set, the `startup-script` `metadata` field will be
overwritten. In other words, `startup_script_file` takes precedence.

The builder does check for a pass/fail/error signal from the startup
script by tracking the `startup-script-status` metadata. Packer will check if this key
is set to done and if it not set to done before the timeout, Packer will fail the build.

### Windows
A Windows startup script can only be provided as a metadata field option. The
builder will _not_ wait for a Windows startup script to terminate. You have
to ensure that it finishes before the instance shuts down. For a list of
supported startup script keys refer to [Using startup scripts on Windows](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts/windows)

```hcl
metadata = {
  sysprep-specialize-script-cmd = "..."
}
```

### Logging

Startup script logs can be copied to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) location
specified via the `startup-script-log-dest` instance creation `metadata` field.
The GCS location must be writeable by the service account of the instance that Packer created.

### Communicator Configuration

#### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/Config-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'


### Temporary SSH keypair

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSHTemporaryKeyPair.mdx'

#### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSHTemporaryKeyPair-not-required.mdx'

### Gotchas

CentOS and recent Debian images have root ssh access disabled by default. Set
`ssh_username` to any user, which will be created by packer with sudo access.

The machine type must have a scratch disk, which means you can't use an
`f1-micro` or `g1-small` to build images.

## Extra disk attachments

@include 'lib/common/BlockDevice.mdx'

These can be defined using the [disk_attachment](#disk_attachment) block in the configuration.

Note that this is an array, and therefore in HCL2 can be defined as multiple blocks, each
one corresponding to a disk that will be attached to the instance you are booting.

Example:

```hcl
source "googlecompute" "example" {
  # Add whichever is necessary to build the image

  disk_attachment {
    volume_type     = "scratch"
    volume_size     = 375
  }

  disk_attachment {
    volume_type     = "pd-standard"
    volume_size     = 25
    interface_type  = "SCSI"
  }
}
```

### Required:

@include 'lib/common/BlockDevice-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'lib/common/BlockDevice-not-required.mdx'

## Customer Encryption Key

Specifying a custom key allows you to use your own encryption keys to encrypt the data
of the image you are creating.

Note: you will need to reuse the same key later on when reusing the image.

@include 'lib/common/CustomerEncryptionKey-not-required.mdx'

## Node Affinities

Node affinity configuration allows you to restrict the nodes on which to run the
instance that Packer will build the image from.
This requires configuring [sole-tenant node groups](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms) first.

@include 'lib/common/NodeAffinity-not-required.mdx'
